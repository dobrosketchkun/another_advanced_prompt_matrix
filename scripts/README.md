Just another variant of advanced prompt matrix script.

Usage: `?white|red|glowing|blue|yellow|pink? hair, $headwear@0.3$`   
`?x|y|z?` - random from a list   
`$headwear@0.3$` - headwear will appear with a probability of 30%   


Put `advanced_prompt_matrix.py` into the scripts folder of stable-diffusion-webui and reload gradio ui.
